      "She teases, then turns, like a spark on the breeze,\nPulling me closer with effortless ease.\nHer eyes catch mineâ€”then slip away fast,\nA storm in her gaze that refuses to pass.",
      "She dances on borders where longing ignites,\nOne step in the sun, one lost in the night.\nHer silence speaks louder than words ever could,\nA push and a pull Iâ€™ve never understood.",
      "If only she'd stay where her glances remain,\nNot vanish like whispers dissolved in the rain.\nFor in that space between near and afar,\nMy heart learns the shape of who we truly are."
